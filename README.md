# KC_Housing_Predictions
Prediction model for housing prices in King County, Washington


Overview:
This project will explore a given King County, Washington dataset to create features and build a model for prediction sales prices in King County.

Business Aim:
Create a model that predicts the sales price of property in King County, Washington. 

Approach:
1.	Data Cleaning - remove outliers and check for any null values
2.	Data Visualization - the data visualization serves two purposes in this project, one is to help check the dataset for any irregularities and the other is to further analyze and explore significant features
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - statistical analysis to determine most significant features
4.	Feature Engineering - after analyzing the existing dataset, new features are created based on statistical significance
5.	Model Testing - Test different linear regression models to determine which model will provide the best predictions
6.	Final Model - Fit final model to dataset 

Summary:


Future:
Future work should look into additional features not offered within the dataset such as economic and educational statistics amongst other things.
